## Crayfish Vm repository README

This repository contains sample data and R scripts for analyzing crayfish resting Vm vs. extracelluar saline. This is a teaching exercise adapted by Glen Ernstrom (Middlebury College) from [Baierlein et al. 2011](https://www.jove.com/video/2322/membrane-potentials-synaptic-responses-neuronal-circuitry)

- **data** contains .csv files pooled from BIOL 370 S19 
- **src** contains R scripts for analyzing and plotting Vm data
- **doc** contains .tex files and supporting graphics for lab handouts; pdfs of useful references

We use [iWorx](https://www.iworx.com/products/animal-physiology/ahk-ta-combination-animalhuman-physiology-teaching-kit/) (Dover, NH) LabScirbe3 and iWorx data recorders for data acquisition. Data are analyzed in R with RStudio or [Igor Pro](https://www.iworx.com/products/animal-physiology/ahk-ta-combination-animalhuman-physiology-teaching-kit/) (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR).
